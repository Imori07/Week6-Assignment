# I achieved all all of the standard requirements. As for stretch goals, i was going to attempt the local storage one however after trying to plan it out i realised it would be difficult for me to implemnet without seeing it done before in react, as im sure there are easier ways. Instead i tried to go with the styling stretch goal which i feel like i may have achieved.

# As for things i found difficult, i would definetely say syntaxes. I found myself constantly having to look back at previous repos of workshops and stuff to check how to code certain things, however the theory behind it the code i understand as in i know what im writing. But i feel as though syntaxes will just come with practice as joe also said.

# Feedback wise, id appreciate it to know if theres parts where i could have simplified certain things or some shortcuts with bits of code, i feel as though that would help and if there is a easy way to implement local storage or do you have to go through each input and make it so its saved to local storage.

# Looking for help, i just mainly looked back on workshops, didnt use youtube or anything else and i didnt come across any major bugs just small fixes which is good.

# I tried doing things abit different compared to workshops as in the demos we were showed to put the html stuff into the app.jsx, i find it cleaner to just put components into components and implement the html code along the way, then finally put it all into a single div in app.jsx. If this is something that might become a problem for me later on, then id like to know.
